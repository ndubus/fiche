# Presentation #

This add-on improves the accessibility of the software Fiche created by Jean-Claude MORTIMOR with NVDA.

It allows to correctly label the fields for creating or modifying a contact.

The phone number is automatically announced when the selected contact is validated.

This behavior is the same as JAWS, when the scripts are installed.

## Compatibility ##

* This addon has been tested with versions of NVDA ranging from 2014.3 up to 2022.1.
